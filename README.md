## Before You Start

The easiest way to get started with the Ignite Engine is through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Before you start, run `[sudo] gem install cocoapods` to install the CocoaPods CLI.


## Installation (In 60 Seconds or Less*)

> This is the best way to start learning the Ignite Engine. It doesn't require fiddling around with setting up a new Xcode project.

1. Download the [Ignite Engine starter kit](https://ignite.apigee.com/StarterKit.zip).

2. Unzip the downloaded folder and move it into a place you'll remember (like `~/Development`!).

3. Open Terminal and `cd` to the new folder (like `cd ~/Development/IgniteEngine`).

4. Type `pod install` to magically download and install all the dependencies.

5. Open the `IgniteEngineApp.xcworkspace` file and run the app in the iOS simulator.

6. Get up to speed by reading the [docs](https://ignite.apigee.com).
 
<sub>* If you have a super awesome internet connection. Otherwise it might take a couple minutes ;)</sub>

## Installation (The Hard Wayâ„¢)

> If you want to learn how to build your own project from scratch and integrate the Ignite Engine, then these steps are for you!

1. Open Xcode 6

2. Create an Single View Application

3. Remove Main.storyboard  (select it, right-click, and choose "Move to Trash")

4. Remove "Main storyboard file base name" entry from Info.plist file.

5. Delete ViewController.h and ViewController.m

6. Create an empty file named `podfile` in the root of your project folder with the following text. *(If you're feeling adventurous and know what you're doing, you can also point directly to the GitHub project).*

    ```
    pod 'IgniteEngine'
    ```

7. Open Terminal, and from your project directory, run `pod install`

8. Once the IgniteEngine pod and all its dependencies have been installed, open [MyProject].xcworkspace from the root of your Xcode project folder. And yes, that's `.xcworkspace`. The `.xcodeproj` file will **not** work.

9. Find main.m

    1. Add `#import IXAppDelegate.h`
    2. Change all references to `AppDelegate` class to `IXAppDelegate`

10. Find AppDelegate.h 
	
	1. Add `#import IXAppDelegate.h`
	2. Replace the `@interface` declaration with `@interface AppDelegate : IXAppDelegate`
	3. Delete `@property (strong, nonatomic) UIWindow *window;`

11. Find AppDelegate.m

	1. Comment out all methods in AppDelegate.m. If you need to override one, you must call `[super *methodname*]` before your own functions.

12. Create a new folder in your project root called `assets`. Drag this folder into Xcode, *deselecting* **Copy items if needed** and *selecting* **Create folder references**.

13. Your IX config will reside in this assets folder. At minimum, you need an `app.json` file and that points to a single view, like so:

	```
	{
	    "$app": {
	        "attributes": {
	            "view.index": "myView.json"
	        }
	    }
	}
	```

14. Get up to speed by reading the [docs](https://ignite.apigee.com).

## Tips

- If you're creating a git repo for your `/assets`, you should add `Pods/**` to your `.gitignore` to avoid commiting your dynamic dependencies to your repo.
