/** This is some sample documentation
 
 Above was the abstract, the rest of the comment is used for the
 discussion section of the documentation. Notice I did an
 unintentional line wrap. Just like html, the document will
 reflow to fit the width of the available page.
 
 Let's do a simple bullet list:
 
 * this is the first line
 * this is the second line
 
 #Section two#
 That was a H1 header we just generated.  Want a hyperlink? Just
 type http://simplicate.weebly.com and it'll  magically turn
 into a link.
 
 Finally, a small table
 
 | header1 | header2 | header3 |
 |---------|:-------:|--------:|
 | normal  |  center |  right  |
 | cell    | cell    | cell    |
